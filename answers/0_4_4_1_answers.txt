1.
- Careers are fluid: expect your path to change and be prepared to adapt.  
- Prioritize transferable skills (communication, problem-solving, learning) over specific job titles.

- Embrace small risks and experiments to gain clarity and practical experience.  
- Invest in continuous learning to keep up with changing industries and technologies.  
- Align choices with evolving values, interests, and strengths rather than fixed long-term plans.  
- Leverage career services and resources to test options and craft a flexible plan.

3.
- Your major is just one part of your story alongside skills, knowledge, values, and talents.  
- It limits the many career possibilities your degree can open.  
- Career interests and opportunities often change between 17 and 25 (and beyond).  
- Fixed planning assumes a predictable future, but technology, economy, climate, and politics create uncertainty.  
- You will change—your values, interests, abilities, and self‑view evolve over time.  
- Treating your major as identity reduces flexibility, creativity, and openness to new paths.  
- Careers aren’t linear; all situations are temporary and exploration can lead to better fits.  
- Viewing your degree as a foundation lets you build diverse career options rather than be confined by a label.

4.
- Skills (technical and transferable)
- Knowledge and subject expertise
- Values and motivations
- Talents and strengths
- Interests and passions
- Work experiences (jobs, internships, co-op)

5.
- New jobs and fields may emerge (technology, climate, policy changes).  
- Some roles may shrink or change in scope; job tasks may be automated or redefined.  
- Employer demand and hiring patterns may shift with the economy and industry trends.  
- Required skills may change — you may need to learn new technical or soft skills.  
- Your values, interests, and strengths may evolve, steering you toward different paths.  
- Internships, volunteer work, and part‑time roles may reveal unexpected careers.  
- Networking and informational interviews can open opportunities you hadn’t considered.  
- Further study, certificates, or credentials may become attractive or necessary.  
- Geographic or sector mobility may create different options than those available now.  
- You may pursue portfolio or hybrid careers instead of a single linear job.

6.
- Asking lots of questions about industries, roles, tasks, and day‑to‑day work instead of assuming you already know the answer
- Exploring a range of possibilities (even those outside your major) and entertaining career paths you hadn’t considered
- Conducting research and curiosity‑driven actions: informational interviews, job shadows, volunteer roles, internships, and attending events
- Trying small experiments and calculated risks to test interests (short projects, micro‑internships, freelance work, course electives)
- Being willing to change direction as you learn more about yourself, the market, and what work feels meaningful
- Looking for clues and patterns in experiences to refine your preferences and priorities
- Applying a learning mindset: treating setbacks and surprises as data, not failures, and iterating on your plans
- Listening to others’ stories and feedback with an open mind to expand how you imagine possible futures
- Focusing on transferable skills and how different roles could use your strengths rather than fixating on job titles
- Balancing curiosity with gradual commitment: make small decisions that create momentum while staying adaptable

7.
- Be curious and open-minded; notice what genuinely interests you and how your interests change over time
- Reflect on your values, skills, talents, and what kinds of challenges you want to tackle
- Ask targeted questions: how far and wide will my degree take me? where and how can I contribute?
- Use design‑thinking: reframe the career question as a problem to prototype and iterate on
- Conduct informational interviews and talk with people in roles/fields of interest
- Network and build connections; watch for opportunities and insider insights
- Take small risks: try short projects, internships, volunteer roles, or contract work to test options

- Research industries, employers, and labour‑market trends (technology, economy, climate, policy)
- Learn to talk about your story and skills confidently; notice which narratives resonate with others
- Jump into current job opportunities to see who’s hiring and what roles look like in practice
- Use career services, mentors, and feedback loops to interpret clues and refine decisions

8.
- Very far and wide: your degree opens multiple career possibilities across industries, roles, and locations.  
- Transferable skills matter: employers value the skills, knowledge, values and talents you developed, not just the major title.  
- Your major shouldn’t define you: combine it with your interests, strengths and values to create varied pathways.  
- Careers aren’t linear: many people change direction; only one in six 25‑year‑olds work in the job they imagined at 17.  
- The future is uncertain: tech, economy, climate and society shape opportunities, so flexibility is key.  
- You shape the outcome: what you want to do and the work that needs doing together determine possibilities.  
- Take action and small risks: experimenting, networking and information interviews reveal real options.  
- Use resources and frameworks: design thinking, career services, research and self‑branding accelerate exploration.  
- Be curious and open‑minded: stay adaptable, learn continuously, and follow emerging clues to new careers.

- Practicing how you talk about yourself increases confidence and attracts opportunities.  
- Exploration through action helps you identify the problems you want to tackle and where you can contribute.

13.
- Because many students think their degree will define their identity and predict their job prospects.  
- Because some believe fixed planning guarantees success and expect a linear career path.  
- Because students expect that identifying an “ideal” career will determine the next five years.  
- Because uncertainty about the future (technology, economy, climate, political and societal change) makes career outcomes unclear.  
- Because students themselves change—their values, interests, abilities, and goals evolve.

17.
1. Clarify your values, interests, strengths, and talents — what matters to you and what energizes you.  
2. Research the work that needs doing: industries, societal problems, and labour-market trends.  
3. Map the overlap: identify roles and problems where your strengths meet real-world needs.  
4. Use design thinking: frame questions like “What challenges do I want to tackle?” and prototype solutions.  
5. Take small risks and iterate: do informational interviews, short projects, volunteering, or internships.  
6. Build transferable skills (communication, problem‑solving, collaboration, tech) that apply across roles.  
7. Network and seek mentors to get clues, feedback, and opportunities you wouldn’t see alone.  
8. Choose experiences that let you make contributions now while keeping options open for change.  
9. Practice talking about your story and impact clearly so employers and collaborators understand your value.  
10. Stay curious and adaptable—reassess periodically and adjust as your interests, the world, and opportunities evolve.

18.
- Because the future is uncertain (technology, the economy, climate, political and social change can alter job prospects).  
- Because you will change over time—your values, interests, abilities, and sense of self may shift.  
- Because a major or early plan doesn’t rigidly determine your career; degrees open multiple possibilities.  
- Because career paths aren’t linear and fixed planning often won’t match how things actually unfold.  
- It doesn’t mean worse—just different; you’ll need to adapt, explore, and reassess.

19.
- Visualize the gap between early expectations and actual career paths (e.g., what you thought at 17 vs. where you are at 25).  
- Show multiple possible routes rather than a single linear career trajectory.  
- Illustrate iterative stages of exploration (design thinking, research, networking, skill-building, applying).  
- Highlight external factors (technology, economy, politics, climate) that alter career outcomes.  
- Normalize change and uncertainty by showing that situations are temporary and paths can shift.  
- Emphasize transferable skills and that a major opens diverse opportunities, not just one job.  
- Encourage small risk-taking and action (informational interviews, networking) by mapping steps to take.  
- Provide clues and decision points to help prioritize choices and next moves.  
- Connect viewers to resources (prepare, job opportunities, career services) for practical follow-through.

20.
Focused on a particular career or pathway.
Have many possibilities.
Very unsure and open to ideas.

21.
- Because careers and life aren’t linear — roles and paths change over time.  
- Because external factors (technology, economy, climate, politics) make the future uncertain and circumstances shift.  
- Because your values, interests, abilities and identity will evolve as you grow.  
- Because each situation offers learning and stepping-stones, not a permanent definition of you.  
- Because multiple options exist and you can revisit or change choices as you gain experience.  
- Because taking small risks and iterating creates new possibilities, so the current state won’t last.

22.
- Career paths don’t follow a single predictable route; people change roles, interests, and goals over time.
- External forces (technology, economy, politics, climate) and personal growth create uncertainty and new possibilities.
- Your major or initial plan won’t rigidly define you; it’s a foundation among many options.
- Progress is iterative—explore, take small risks, learn, and adapt rather than expecting a straight line.

23.
- Career exploration using Design Thinking to help define what career means to you  
- One-on-one advising that meets you wherever you are in the process (focused, exploring, or unsure)

25.
Design Thinking — definition
- A human-centered, solution-based, iterative approach for solving complex, unclear problems. Core phases: empathize (understand people/needs), define (frame the problem), ideate (generate many options), prototype (build low‑cost experiments), and test (learn and refine).

How it applies to defining your career
- Treat your career as a design challenge: you don’t need a single fixed answer; you explore and iterate.
- Empathize with yourself and the market: clarify your values, skills, interests, and the needs/opportunities in workplaces.
- Define a focused question (e.g., “What kinds of work let me solve X problem and use Y skills?”).
- Ideate broadly: list many possible roles, industries, and pathways without judging them.
- Prototype quickly and cheaply: do info interviews, short internships, volunteer roles, freelance projects, part‑time jobs, or shadowing to test options.
- Test and learn: reflect on what you enjoyed, what fit, and what didn’t; use that feedback to refine your next experiments.
- Repeat iteratively: small risks and continual learning build clarity, flexibility, and new possibilities for your career.

26.
- Request informational interviews with professionals in fields of interest
- Attend networking events, career fairs, or industry meetups and start conversations
- Send cold emails or LinkedIn messages asking for advice or a brief chat
