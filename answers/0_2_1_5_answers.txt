Failure to attend does not constitute withdrawal — courses not formally dropped will be given a failing grade, and you remain responsible for the tuition fee.

Allowed changes: courses may be added or dropped or tutorial times changed via the enrollment system without prior departmental approval; course challenge/audit changes must be approved by the department (students may change challenge enrollment or switch to regular enrollment).  
Refund: 100% tuition refund for courses dropped on or before the 7th calendar day.

34.
Allowed changes: students may drop courses via goSFU; change enrollment in a course challenge to another course or to regular enrollment (department permission required); courses may be added with the permission of the department (no courses can be added or changed to audit status); dropping all term courses will be recorded as a withdrawal.

Refund: 75% refund for courses dropped between the 8th and 14th calendar day.

- WE applications are normally denied if the student applies more than once for the same reason, if a retroactive WE is requested more than five years after the date of application, or if there is an academic dishonesty incident report for the course.  
- “Extenuating circumstances” are defined as unusual circumstances beyond the student’s control that make it impossible to complete the course.

If hardship occurs, the student will be given a new exam date (within the established exam period) for the second exam causing hardship by the instructor or department/faculty; for exams at more than one location, arrangements will be made so both exams can be written at a single location. Students must notify the instructor(s) and department one month prior to the exam date.

- The university respects both the right of unions/members to engage in lawful strike activity and the right of students and instructors to choose whether to cross a legal picket line, and trusts them to understand the consequences of that choice.  
- The guidelines set out responsibilities for students and instructors when they choose to cross or not cross a legal picket line of a union of which they are not a member.  
- Students who do NOT cross a legal picket line and whose course/lab/tutorial proceeds must follow the outlined student responsibilities and, for grading concerns, follow the Grading and Reconsideration of Grades Policy (T 20.01) (instructor first, then chair); see Academic Concessions and Communications sections as needed.  
- Instructors who do NOT cross a legal picket line have specified responsibilities; instructors of record must provide clear, timely communication to students about expectations during a labour dispute.  
- Instructors have a legal duty to accommodate students with disabilities (per SFU Accessibility and Human Rights policies); they should keep the Centre for Accessible Learning (CAL) apprised of course changes that affect accommodated students.  
- Assignment of grades should follow established grading practices as much as possible; if a labour dispute makes that impossible, the university may enact extraordinary measures to ensure course completion.

49.
