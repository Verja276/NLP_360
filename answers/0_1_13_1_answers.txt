What is a Social Insurance Number (SIN)?
- A SIN is a unique nine‑digit number issued by the Government of Canada (Service Canada) used to administer government programs and for tax and employment purposes; you must provide it to employers and post‑secondary institutions for income reporting and tax forms. Keep it private.

How do you obtain one?
- Apply through Service Canada (online, by mail, or in person at a Service Canada Centre). You must submit original identity and immigration documents proving your legal status (e.g., Canadian birth certificate or citizenship card, permanent resident card, or a valid passport plus a study/work permit that authorizes employment). There is no fee; processing and documentation requirements are detailed on the Service Canada website.

6.
An ITN (Individual Tax Number) is a tax identification number issued by the Canada Revenue Agency for people who are not eligible for a Social Insurance Number but need a Canadian tax identifier (for example non‑residents who must file a Canadian tax return or receive Canadian tax slips).

To obtain an ITN you complete CRA Form T1261 (Application for a CRA Individual Tax Number for Non‑Residents), submit the form with original or certified copies of required identity documents (e.g. passport) per the form’s instructions, and mail them to the CRA’s International Tax Services Office (or follow the alternate submission instructions on the form). The CRA will review the application and issue the ITN by mail.

Update your student record to include your SIN or ITN so the university can include it on your tax forms (T2202 and T4A).
