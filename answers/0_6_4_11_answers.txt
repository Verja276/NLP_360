1.
Short-Term Summer Programs are study-abroad opportunities at 30+ SFU exchange partner institutions that let you earn 2–12 units toward your SFU degree in a condensed 1–10 week format. They provide international education experience with social programming and field trips, often part-time, enabling you to experience a new culture, gain new academic perspectives, build networks abroad, and develop global competencies. Tuition is usually paid to SFU (except direct fee‑paying hosts), and you apply via the exchange application (January deadline).
