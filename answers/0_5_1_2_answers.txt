- A heavier course load raises your immediate term tuition and out‑of‑pocket costs, which may strain your budget or require loans/extra work.  
- Taking more courses per term can shorten time to degree and may reduce total tuition and living costs overall.  
- Spreading courses over more terms lowers per‑term expenses but can increase total tuition, living costs and delay graduation.  
- Full‑time vs part‑time status (and related fee structures) affects eligibility for financial aid, scholarships and benefits, so it influences how many courses you can afford to take.  
- Delaying graduation risks future tuition increases and extended living/expense commitments.  
- Use a cost calculator and budgeting (and consider work‑study or other income) to compare short‑term affordability versus long‑term cost savings.
