31.
Fixed costs are expenses that don’t change very often and remain roughly the same month‑to‑month or term‑to‑term (somewhat “non‑negotiable”).  
Variable costs are expenses that can go up or down depending on how much you consume or use something and are less predictable.

32.
F — Financial aid and awards: scholarships, awards, bursaries, government student loans/grants, Indigenous and specific‑eligibility supports; contact Financial Aid Advisors for eligibility and applications.

T — Tuition & fees: term tuition/fees (calculator uses 2025/26 rates); SFU Payment Plan lets you pay in installments (2% monthly interest).

I — Income opportunities: Co‑op placements, Work‑Study program, and on‑campus jobs (TAs, RAs, bookstore, SFSS roles, media positions).

33.
They don’t change very often — you can expect to pay the same dollar amount month‑by‑month or term‑by‑term.

T — Tuition & Fees (tuition, payment plans)
