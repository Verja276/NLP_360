001-416-380-6578

24.
Yes.

25.
The chat works through the free My SSP app and functions the same abroad as it does in Canada/US, giving you live support via in-app chat.  
You need mobile data (provider network) or a Wi‑Fi connection; some countries’ firewall protections may block the app, in which case call My SSP instead.

26.
- Call My SSP instead of using the app.  
- From Canada or the U.S.: 1-833-768-2188  
- Outside North America: 001-416-380-6578 (you can use the collect-call option to connect directly; explain you’re a student accessing My SSP from outside Canada/U.S.)  
- If using chat, first check your internet connectivity—some countries’ firewalls block the app.

27.
Call 001-416-380-6578 (outside of North America)

Place a collect call (operator-assisted) to connect directly with My SSP

28.
A collect call is a call where charges are billed to the recipient (so the caller does not pay) and the recipient must accept the charges.  
Using the collect call option bypasses the My SSP auto-attendant and connects you directly with a representative—be prepared to state you are a student accessing My SSP from outside Canada/U.S.

29.
Yes. Making calls over Wi‑Fi may still count against your regular minutes and could be charged (including as an international call) depending on your phone plan — check your carrier’s policies.

30.
- Check your internet/Wi‑Fi connectivity.  
- If your country’s firewall blocks the app, try calling My SSP instead.  
- Review your carrier’s policies — Wi‑Fi calls may still count against minutes or incur international charges.

31.
No — your conversations are confidential and never shared with SFU.
