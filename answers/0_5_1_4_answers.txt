What are my options for the future?
- Explore career areas that align with your interests, skills and values through self-assessment, informational interviews, internships/volunteering, and industry research. Options can include entry-level jobs, professional training/certifications, graduate school, entrepreneurship, or sector changes depending on your goals and experience.

What can I do with my degree?
- Map your degree’s transferrable skills (research, analysis, communication, project management) to job roles and industries. Use job postings and LinkedIn to identify typical entry roles, required skills, and career pathways; consider internships, volunteer roles or short-term contracts to gain relevant experience.

How can I prepare for what's next?
- Clarify goals (short- and long-term), update your résumé/CV and LinkedIn, build targeted skills via courses or volunteer work, network and do informational interviews, apply strategically to jobs with tailored applications, and practice interviewing (mock interviews available by referral). Book a 1:1 career appointment or attend drop-ins for personalized guidance.

Should I pursue further training or attend graduate school?
- Decide based on career goals: if your target role requires advanced credentials or research experience, grad school may be appropriate. Consider cost, time, career outcomes, alternatives (professional certificates, work experience, apprenticeships), and opportunities to try relevant roles first. Consult a Career Educator to weigh options and plan application/timelines.

11.
Ask yourself (quick checklist)
- What exact roles do I want long-term, and do those roles explicitly require a graduate degree or professional credential?
- What skills or experience am I missing that prevent me from getting those roles now?
- Do I prefer academic/research work or applied/professional work?
- Can I afford tuition and time away from paid work? Are there funding/scholarship options?
- How strong is my academic record for admission? Do I have potential referees?
- Do I need to switch fields, or deepen expertise in my current field?
- Am I ready for 1–3+ years of full-time study, or would part-time/online study be better?

How to interpret your answers
- If your target jobs require a master’s/PhD or research credentials (e.g., academia, certain clinical/research roles), prioritize graduate school.
- If employers value applied skills, certifications, or hands‑on experience (e.g., tech, project management, many industry roles), short courses, certificates, bootcamps, or targeted training + work experience are often higher ROI.
- If you’re unsure, gain 6–12 months of relevant work or volunteer experience first — this clarifies interests and strengthens future applications.
- If funding, time, or admission competitiveness are major barriers, consider part‑time/online graduate programs or micro‑credentials as intermediate steps.
- If you have a strong research interest and potential supervisors at programs you like, that’s a good sign to apply.

Alternatives to immediate grad school
- Professional certificates, microcredentials, bootcamps
- Short courses and online learning (Coursera, edX, industry providers)
- Internships, co‑ops, volunteer roles, contract work
- Professional designations or licensure relevant to your field
- Part‑time or bridging master’s programs, or post‑baccalaureate diplomas

Practical comparison points (use when choosing)
- Cost and funding (stipend, scholarship, employer sponsorship)
- Time to completion and opportunity cost of lost earnings
- Career outcomes and typical salaries after completion
- Admission requirements and your competitiveness
- Mode of delivery (in‑person vs online vs part‑time)
- Networking and experiential learning opportunities

Next steps (actionable)
- Scan job ads in your target field to see what credentials employers list.
- Do 3–5 informational interviews with people in roles you want.
- Try a short online course to test interest and build skills.
- If considering research grad school, contact potential supervisors and ask about projects and funding.
- If considering professional training, compare curricula, industry recognition, and alumni outcomes.
- Book a 1:1 with a Career Educator at SFU (myExperience) to review goals, CV, and options — bring your CV and sample job postings. You can also call 778-782-3106 or email careers@sfu.ca.

If you want, tell me: your field, current level (UG/PG), work experience, and target roles — I can give a tailored recommendation.

Curriculum Vitae (CV): A comprehensive, detailed record of your education, academic accomplishments, research, publications and credentials used for academic or research‑based positions.

22.
There are many paths: entering the workforce in roles that match your skills, doing internships/co‑op or volunteer work to gain experience, pursuing professional training or certificates, applying to graduate or professional schools, starting a business or freelance work, or exploring research/academic opportunities. Use career exploration (self‑assessment, informational interviews, job market research) to narrow options that fit your interests and values.

You can leverage your degree in multiple sectors—private industry, non‑profits, government, education, research, or entrepreneurship—depending on your major and transferable skills. Translate coursework and experiences into concrete skills on your resume, pursue relevant experience (work, volunteer, projects), and target roles where your knowledge and strengths align.

Prepare by clarifying goals, building a tailored resume/CV and cover letter, optimizing your LinkedIn, gaining relevant experience (volunteer, part‑time, internships, projects), practicing interviews or doing mock interviews, networking and informational interviewing, and developing any technical or professional skills employers seek. Use job search strategies (targeted applications, employer research) and seek feedback from career services.

Whether to pursue further training or graduate school depends on your career goals, required credentials in your field, financial/time considerations, and what you’ll gain versus entering the workforce first. Research program outcomes, speak with advisors and professionals in the field, consider alternatives (certificates, short courses, work experience), and use a career educator to weigh pros and cons.

Networking skills — quick principles and actions
- Start with the right mindset: networking = building relationships and mutual help, not just asking for jobs. Be curious and generous.
- Prepare a 30–45 second elevator pitch: who you are, what you do/study, what you’re interested in, and one specific ask (advice, referral, info). Example: “Hi, I’m Maya, a 3rd-year SFU biology student interested in environmental consulting. I’m exploring entry roles and would love 15 minutes of your time to learn about how you entered the field.”
- Research before reaching out: know the person’s role, company, and recent accomplishments so your message is targeted.
- Use short, personalized outreach messages (see templates below).
- Ask for informational interviews (15–30 minutes) focused on learning—prepare 5–7 focused questions about their path, day-to-day, skills needed, and hiring trends.
- Active listening: take notes, reflect back what you heard, ask follow-ups, and avoid dominating the conversation.
- Offer value: share a relevant article, introduce them to someone, or provide a small helpful insight when appropriate.
- Follow up and stay in touch: send a prompt thank-you message, summarize one insight you found valuable, and check in every few months with updates or useful info.
- Diversify your network: connect with alumni, peers, faculty, professional groups, and people in roles tangential to your goals.
- Practice networking in low-pressure settings: labs, classes, volunteering, student clubs, and career events. Use mock interviews and role-plays to build confidence.

Short outreach message templates
- Connection request (LinkedIn): “Hi [Name], I’m an SFU [program/year] student interested in [field]. I enjoyed your post/work at [Company]. I’d love to connect and learn more about your experience in [specific area].”
- Informational interview request (email/LinkedIn): “Hi [Name], I’m [Name], an SFU [program/year] studying [major]. I’m exploring careers in [field] and would greatly appreciate 15–20 minutes to ask about your path and advice. Are you available for a brief call or coffee in the next two weeks? Thank you for considering.”
- Thank-you / follow-up: “Thank you for your time today. I appreciated learning about [specific insight]. I’ll follow up on [action you said you’d do]. If you’re open, I’d like to stay in touch.”

LinkedIn profile — prioritized checklist
1. Photo: professional, friendly headshot (face visible, neutral background).
2. Headline: clear and keyword-rich (role/interests + job-seeking status if relevant). Example: “Environmental Science Student | Data Analysis & GIS | Seeking Summer Internship.”
3. About / Summary: 3–5 short paragraphs—who you are, top skills/achievements with metrics, what you’re seeking, and a specific call to action (ask to connect or contact). Use first person.
   Example opening: “I’m a 3rd-year SFU Marketing student with experience managing social campaigns that grew engagement 40%. I’m seeking summer roles in digital marketing—happy to connect or chat about opportunities.”
4. Experience: list roles with bullet-style achievements and quantifiable results (what you did, how you did it, outcome).
5. Education: include relevant courses, projects, and honors.
6. Featured section: pin a portfolio, project, resume, or presentation that demonstrates your work.
7. Skills & endorsements: list 8–12 relevant skills; prioritize top 3. Ask peers and supervisors for endorsements.
8. Recommendations: request 2–3 short recommendations from supervisors, professors, or teammates that highlight your strengths.

- Post succinct professional content: project results, reflections on industry trends, or highlights from events. Aim for consistency (e.g., 1x/week).
- After an informational chat, ask if they’ll introduce you to one other person; make the ask specific.

Your options include entering the workforce (entry-level roles, internships or co-ops), volunteering or research positions, pursuing further education (graduate or professional school), or starting your own venture — career educators can help you explore which path fits your education, interests, and experience.

With your degree you can pursue roles directly related to your field or leverage transferable skills (communication, analysis, research, project management) across sectors — consider industry jobs, government or non-profit work, research/academic roles, or further study depending on your goals.

Prepare by clarifying your goals through career exploration, building targeted resumes/CVs and cover letters, networking (including LinkedIn and informational interviews), searching and applying strategically for work/volunteer roles, and practising interviews (mock interviews available); book 1:1 appointments or use drop-in services to get tailored help.

Whether to pursue further training or graduate school depends on your intended career — discuss your goals with a Career Educator to weigh requirements, benefits, costs, and alternatives (work experience, certificates, professional development) and make an informed decision.
