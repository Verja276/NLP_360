Emails from SFU Safety are automated notifications from Safety Spectrum:

- Training notifications: reminders when a certification is nearing expiry (typically 90 days before, shortly before, and after expiry). Not all certifications expire, so you won’t get reminders for those without an expiry date.

- Action items / Corrective actions (Inspections & Incidents): you receive these because you’ve been assigned responsibility to complete an action or corrective action; the email is a summary—click the link to log in to Safety Spectrum for full details and to accept or decline.

- Contractor Module (Project managers): project managers may receive emails about contractor safety requirements and project updates.

Reminders are only sent for certifications that have an expiry date and are nearing expiry (typically 90 days before, shortly before, and after expiry). If a certification doesn’t have an expiry date, you will not receive reminders.

8.
Action items — Tasks generated from inspections that are assigned to individuals to follow up on identified issues; tracked in Safety Spectrum.

Corrective actions — Tasks arising from incident investigations intended to fix root causes and prevent recurrence; assigned and tracked in Safety Spectrum.

9.
Action items come from inspections; corrective actions come from incident investigations. You’re receiving the email because you’ve been assigned responsibility to complete one. The email is a summary—click the link to log in to Safety Spectrum for full details (who assigned it, notes/attachments) and to accept or decline the item.

10.
Click the link in the SFU Safety email to log in to Safety Spectrum — the email is a summary; once logged in open the action item/corrective action to view full details (who assigned it, notes/attachments) and to accept or decline it. If you don’t have the email, log in to Safety Spectrum and open the item from your dashboard/tasks to view the same details.

11.
As a project manager, you receive Contractor Module emails notifying you about contractor safety requirements and project updates.

12.
Safety Spectrum pulls employee and reporting-structure data from SFU’s MyInfo. If your reporting relationships in MyInfo are incomplete or incorrect, advise EHS (srs-sms-feedback@sfu.ca). Note that reporting relationships for TAs, graduate students and some RAs are not reflected in the system.

15.
Safety Spectrum imports reporting relationships from SFU’s MyInfo system, and TAs, graduate students and some RAs are not recorded (or are managed differently) in MyInfo, so their reporting relationships don’t appear. If you believe a reporting relationship is incorrect or missing, please advise EHS.

Certain certifications like SFU Safety Orientation and Respectful Work and Learning Environments are assigned to all employees. Additional certifications are assigned based on your job role, work activities, and regulatory requirements. Supervisors and EHS determine which training is necessary to meet compliance obligations.

Most SFU employees are assigned the Office Ergonomics certification because computer-based work carries a risk of musculoskeletal injury and this training helps meet WorkSafeBC requirements.

Contact srs-sms-feedback@sfu.ca with questions about specific certifications and you will be connected to the appropriate EHS team member.

Previously, some Canvas courses issued certificates via an add‑in called Accredible, which had a different design and format. Now all SFU safety training certificates are generated directly from Safety Spectrum (Accredible is being phased out), so records and certificate designs are different.

33.
Yes. Safety committee members receive inspection training both on Canvas and in person. Anyone participating in a laboratory inspection can complete the Laboratory Safety Inspection Training on Canvas. Resource guides for inspectors, including a user guide specifically for safety committee inspectors, are also available to support you before and during inspections.

34.
In Safety Spectrum you can only select one asset per inspection checklist. However, EHS has created “zones” (groups of related spaces) so you can complete a checklist at the zone level rather than filling out one for each individual room — this works well for lab and safety committee inspections where multiple rooms are inspected.

35.
Zones are groups of related spaces created by EHS. Because Safety Spectrum only allows one asset per inspection checklist, you can select a zone as the asset and complete a single checklist at the zone level instead of filling out one for each room. This is useful for lab and safety committee inspections covering multiple rooms.

36.
Only EHS (Safety Spectrum Administrators) can make changes. To request an edit, email srs-sms-feedback@sfu.ca. Note: changes to safety committee inspection checklists must first be agreed upon by the committee.

37.
Only EHS (as Safety Spectrum Administrators)

38.
If the asset doesn’t appear in the dropdown, it means you do not have access to it in Safety Spectrum. In most cases, this happens because you are not assigned as an inspector for that asset. To request inspector access, email srs-sms-feedback@sfu.ca.

39.
Email srs-sms-feedback@sfu.ca to request inspector access for the asset.
