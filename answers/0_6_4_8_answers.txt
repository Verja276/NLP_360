What is an exchange?
An exchange is a study‑abroad program at one of SFU’s 130+ partner institutions (including select virtual exchanges) where you live and study in the host country, take courses—mostly taught in English—and earn credit toward your SFU degree while typically paying your regular SFU tuition.
