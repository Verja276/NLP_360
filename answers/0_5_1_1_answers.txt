Finding a course load that gives you balance in life both on and off-campus while you pursue your academic, professional, and personal goals—choosing what’s right for your needs rather than a “perfect” number.

3.
- Clarify your learning objectives and degree requirements (units, prerequisites, and timeline for completion)
- Balance academic, professional and personal goals so your course load supports life on and off campus
- Assess your current life circumstances (work, family, health, commute) and realistic weekly time for study
- Start with a manageable number of units and allow flexibility to adjust as your needs evolve
- Give yourself time before enrolling each term to reassess priorities and plans
- Consult an Academic Advisor for personalized guidance and to see the bigger picture

- Because plans for degree completion may shift, requiring different courses or pacing.  
- Because flexibility helps you find a balanced course load that supports academic, professional, and personal goals.  
- Because giving yourself time allows better decision‑making before enrolling each term.  
- Because advisors can help you adjust plans to fit the bigger picture.

Learning objectives:
- Aiming for deeper mastery (research, capstone, honors) may require more advanced, time‑intensive courses or fewer courses to focus on depth.
- Seeking breadth or multiple minors/certificates may increase the number of courses per term.
- Needing specific skills (labs, studios, internships) can change the type and workload of courses you choose.

Educational path:
- Degree requirements, major/minor changes or adding credentials can raise or shift your course load to meet required credits.
- Course sequencing and prerequisites may force lighter or heavier terms depending on what’s available when.
- Transfer credits, co-op or study‑abroad plans can accelerate or delay course load in certain terms.

Life circumstances:
- Employment, caregiving, health or financial responsibilities may require a reduced (part‑time) course load.
- Personal commitments, commuting or relocation affect how many and what kind of courses you can manage.
- Mental health or unexpected events may necessitate flexibility and temporary adjustments to course load.
