- Fixed costs: expenses that stay the same or change rarely—build these into your baseline budget as “must-pay” each month/term. Examples: tuition and mandatory fees, rent, insurance, loan payments, some subscription plans, and recurring program fees.

- Variable costs: expenses that fluctuate with use and choices—treat these as flexible categories you can cut or expand. Examples: groceries and dining out, transportation and gas, utilities if usage-based, books and supplies, entertainment, clothing, personal items.

- How to use them together: total your fixed costs first to establish the minimum amount you must cover each term; then allocate the remainder to variable categories with realistic limits.

- Budgeting tips: track actual spending to set accurate allowances; decide which variable items are essentials vs “nice-to-have”; build a small buffer for irregular or one-time costs (laptop, travel home); look for student discounts and on‑campus resources to reduce costs; revisit and adjust your variable limits each term.
