- List all fixed (tuition, fees, rent, insurance) and variable (food, transport, entertainment, supplies) costs so you can see what’s non‑negotiable versus adjustable.  
- Use SFU’s cost calculator to estimate expenses per academic term and add one‑time purchases (laptop, equipment) and recurring travel visits.  
- Build a practical term budget: prioritize essentials, set limits on variable spending, and identify specific areas to cut if needed.  
- Explore all funding sources: scholarships, awards, bursaries, government loans/grants, Indigenous or disability supports, US federal loans/VA benefits, and youth‑in‑care programs.  
- Pursue income opportunities: co‑op placements, Work‑Study, on‑campus jobs, and research/TA positions to earn supplemental income and gain experience.  
- Consider SFU’s Payment Plan if needed (pay by installments; 2% monthly interest applies) to manage cash flow.  
- Use campus resources and student discounts (Rec Centre, Health & Counselling, software/media discounts, food supports) to reduce costs.  
- Track spending each term, revisit and adjust your budget, and consult a Financial Aid Advisor for tailored help or to discuss additional assistance.

21.
Fixed costs are expenses that don’t change very often and you can expect to pay the same dollar amount month-by-month or term-by-term. They are relatively predictable — you can forecast them over the next year or so and consider them somewhat “non‑negotiable.”

22.
Variable costs are expenses that fluctuate based on how much you consume or use (e.g., groceries, utilities, entertainment), so the amount can increase or decrease month-to-month. They differ from fixed costs, which remain largely constant and predictable over time (e.g., tuition, rent); variable costs are less predictable and can be adjusted more easily by changing usage or spending.

23.
- Gather your costs: tuition/fees, housing, utilities, groceries, transportation, textbooks/supplies, personal, and any one-time items (laptop, equipment, travel).
- Enter fixed costs into the calculator (tuition, rent, insurance, subscriptions) so they’re reflected term-by-term.
- Enter variable monthly costs (food, transit, entertainment) and adjust amounts to reflect realistic usage.
- Add one-time and occasional expenses using the “+ Add other fixed and variable monthly expenses” option.
- Provide as much detail as possible—the more you enter, the more accurate the estimate for the single academic term (four months).
- Review the calculator’s term total and use it to set spending limits for each category; mark non-negotiable (fixed) vs discretionary (variable) items.
- Identify areas to trim (use student discounts, free on‑campus services) and re-run the calculator after adjustments.
- If cashflow is an issue, consider SFU’s Payment Plan (installments with 2% monthly interest) and factor that into your budget.
- Save or note the results, then revisit and recalculate each term as your circumstances change.
- If you need help interpreting results or finding funding, book a Financial Aid Advisor appointment via Advisor Link or the appointment request form.
