1.
- Make an appointment with an academic advisor as soon as possible.  
- If you’re on Academic Probation, work with an advisor to develop a plan to return to Good Academic Standing.  
- Talk to your instructor about your progress and possible options (e.g., deferrals, extensions).  
- Use tutoring and academic supports (Student Learning Commons, study-skill workshops).  
- Check withdrawal deadlines and consider a Withdrawal Under Extenuating Circumstances if appropriate.

2.
Yes. If you are on Academic Probation you should make an appointment with an academic advisor as soon as possible to help you work toward Good Academic Standing.

3.
What is Academic Probation (OAP)?
- You are placed on Academic Probation if you have attempted at least 9 units and your cumulative GPA (CGPA) is below 2.00.  
- It indicates you are not in Good Academic Standing; sustained marginal passes (C- or D) can lead to OAP.  
- While on OAP you may be ineligible for a Letter of Permission (LOP).

How does it work?
- Academic standing is evaluated at the end of each term once you have attempted nine or more units.  
- To get off probation you must achieve both a Term GPA and a CGPA of 2.00 or higher at the next evaluation.  
- If, while on OAP, your Term GPA is below 2.00 AND your CGPA is below 2.00, you will be Required to Withdraw (RTW).  
- You may be placed on Continued Academic Probation (CAP) until you attain a Term GPA ≥ 2.00; during CAP you may repeat failed courses.  
- You should meet with an academic advisor as soon as possible for planning and support.

4.
After you have attempted nine units — your record is first evaluated at the end of that term (and then at the end of each subsequent term).

5.
9 units

6.
Below 2.00

7.
Yes — if after attempting at least 9 units your cumulative GPA is below 2.00 you will be placed on Academic Probation, even if you passed all courses (e.g., with marginal C-/D grades).

8.
Even if you pass every course, sustained performance at the marginal pass level (C- or D) will lower your CGPA below 2.00 and result in being placed on Academic Probation (OAP).

9.
No. Students on Academic Probation may not be approved for a Letter of Permission (LOP) to take courses at another institution.

10.
- Raise both your Term GPA and your Cumulative GPA to 2.00 or higher (your standing is re‑evaluated at the end of the next completed term).  
- Book an appointment with an academic advisor immediately to develop a plan to get off probation.  
- Repeat failed courses if eligible to improve your CGPA (follow repeat limits and department permission rules).  
- Use supports: tutoring, Student Learning Commons workshops, study‑skill resources, and referrals from advisors.  
- If applicable, consider the Back on Track program (three‑term supported program) or apply for a Withdrawal Under Extenuating Circumstances if appropriate.

11.
At the end of the next completed term.

24.
What is the Back on Track Program?
A three-term student success program (for first-time RTW students) that provides guided analysis of academic difficulties, personalized academic advice and support, career advising, and structured learning-skill development, with concurrent credit course enrollment in Terms 2 and 3.

How can it help students who are RTW?
By addressing the factors behind poor performance, teaching study and learning skills, offering personalized academic and career guidance, allowing supported reenrollment in credit courses, and improving students’ chances of returning to Good Academic Standing and completing their degree.

27.
A Withdrawal Under Extenuating Circumstances (WE) is a withdrawal granted after the regular course‑drop deadline for students who experienced unusual circumstances beyond their control; if approved, a WE notation appears on the transcript (approval is not guaranteed).

You would apply for a WE if you have passed the deadline to drop courses on your own and events beyond your control made it impossible for you to complete the course.

28.
If your application for a Withdrawal Under Extenuating Circumstances (WE) is approved after you’ve passed the drop deadline.

29.
- Talk to your instructor (get feedback, possible deferrals or extensions)  
- Tutoring and other supports (study skills classes, workshops, Student Learning Commons)  
- Check withdrawal deadlines  
- Consider financial implications (consult a Financial Aid Advisor)  
- Apply for a Withdrawal Under Extenuating Circumstances (WE) if you missed the deadline

30.
Yes — talk to your instructor. You don’t need their approval to drop the course, but they can tell you how you’re doing, suggest improvements, and explain other options (e.g., deferrals, extensions).

31.
- Talk to your instructor (office hours) for feedback and options (deferrals, extensions).  
- Tutoring through the Student Learning Commons.  
- Study-skill classes and workshops (Student Learning Commons / campus workshops).  
- Academic advisors in Student Services for course planning and referrals to supports.  
- Financial Aid Advisor (if withdrawing would affect loans/scholarships).

32.
- Withdrawing can impact your current or future financial assistance (may affect eligibility or amounts).  
- If you have a student loan or a scholarship/bursary, meet with a Financial Aid Advisor to notify them and get guidance.  
- See SFU Financial Aid (www.sfu.ca/students/financialaid/) for more information.

34.
- You may not repeat more than five courses in a degree program (courses with prior transfer credit count toward this limit).  
- This limit may be extended by the dean of the faculty.  
- No individual course may be repeated more than once except with permission of the department; enrolling a course for a third time requires departmental permission.

35.
No — you may not repeat an individual course more than once except with permission of the department; students wishing to enroll a third time should consult the department.

36.
- You may not receive transfer credit for a course that is a repeat of a course you already passed at SFU.  
- If you take a repeat at another institution and pass, the transfer credit will remain on your SFU record as a repeat with zero unit value.  
- If you fail the repeat elsewhere or drop it, the transfer credit will still remain on your record.  
- A department may allow credit to count for both the transfer course and an SFU course if the content is judged sufficiently different.  
- Current limits on course repeats (including the five-course repeat limit) apply to repeated transfer courses, and this policy does not change how GPAs are calculated.
