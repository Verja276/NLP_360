The graduate letter includes only essential enrolment details because many undergraduate-specific items (e.g., majors/minors, certain program requirements or course listings) don’t apply to individualized graduate programs. Graduate records are managed differently, so the template is pared down to the information that is relevant and verifiable for graduate students.
