What is religious accommodation?
Religious accommodation is the right to have your religious practices (e.g., time away from or modifications to work or study to observe holy days or rites) accommodated by employers and public-service providers (such as universities). The obligation to accommodate is mandatory, not discretionary, and applies up to the point of undue hardship.

Why do we accommodate?
We accommodate because the B.C. Human Rights Code prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion; accommodating ensures equal access and fair treatment. Accommodation must be provided unless it would cause undue hardship (assessed case-by-case by factors like cost, workforce disruption, and impact on others).

We accommodate because the B.C. Human Rights Code prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion; institutions like the University must provide equal access and respect for religious diversity. Accommodation is required unless it would cause undue hardship, which is determined case by case (factors include relative cost, workforce disruption, effect on others, and timing).

9.
- It means the University/employer is legally required to make reasonable adjustments for religious practices unless doing so would cause undue hardship — it cannot simply refuse as a matter of choice.

- The duty is mandatory under the B.C. Human Rights Code; accommodation must be pursued in good faith and assessed case-by-case.

- The institution bears the burden to show undue hardship (e.g., excessive cost, major workforce disruption, or significant impact on others) before refusing accommodation.

- Practically, this prohibits penalizing or ignoring bona fide accommodation requests and requires proactive, reasonable solutions (e.g., rescheduling, alternate deadlines) where possible.

10.
Religious accommodation is the right to have one’s religious practices (e.g., time away or modifications to work/study to follow faith tenets) accommodated by employers and public service providers. We accommodate because discrimination on the basis of religion is prohibited under the B.C. Human Rights Code; institutions like the University have a mandatory duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. To request it, students/employees should notify their professor or employer as early as possible.

Accommodation can take many forms depending on the request: excusal from classes or exams for recognized holy days with opportunity to make up work, rescheduling or moving exams, extended time, breaks for prayer or to break fast, alternative assignment deadlines, or other adjustments. There is no legal duty to accommodate optional or purely social faith-based events.

Undue hardship is the legal limit to accommodation — accommodation must be provided unless it would create unduly onerous conditions. Determination is case-by-case and considers factors such as cost relative to the institution’s budget, disruption to the workforce, and impact on other students/employees; short notice can increase risk of undue hardship. Undue hardship is a high threshold and rarely met.

Yes — there is a difference between days of religious and cultural significance. Some culturally significant celebrations (e.g., Chinese New Year) may be important and the University may grant time off, but there is no automatic legal requirement to accommodate purely cultural observances in the same way as religious holy days.

11.
1. Submit your request to your professor or employer as early as possible (contact them as soon as you know of the need).  
2. Check important dates (class, exams — exam schedule released Week 7) and note when your religious holidays occur.  
3. Be open and specific about the accommodation you are asking for and be willing to work on a solution.  
4. Follow up the conversation promptly with a thank-you email that includes: your name and ID, class code, relevant date(s), what you discussed, and a recap of the accommodation requested.  
5. If you need help preparing the request, consult the Multifaith Centre or Human Rights Office.  
6. If your request is denied, contact the Human Rights Office to have it reviewed.  
7. Remember the University must accommodate up to the point of undue hardship.

- Undue hardship is reached when accommodating a religious practice would create unduly onerous conditions for the University.  
- It is determined on a case‑by‑case basis.  
- Factors considered include cost (relative to the University’s overall budget), disruption of the workforce, and the effect on other students and employees.  
- Leaving too little time to make an accommodation can be a significant factor in finding undue hardship.  
- Undue hardship is a high threshold and is only met in limited circumstances.

- Short notice limits practical options (e.g., finding alternate exam times, covering classes, or reallocating work), making feasible solutions harder or impossible.  
- It increases logistical and administrative burden and potential costs (e.g., hiring proctors, arranging rooms or makeup assessments) on short notice.  
- It heightens disruption to other students, staff, or the instructor’s schedule, so accommodating would more likely create onerous conditions.
