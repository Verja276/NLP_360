3.
Calculates your cumulative (and term) GPA from the courses you enter by using their grades and units.

4.
Calculates the GPA you must earn in upcoming course(s)/term (based on your current CGPA, total units, and planned units) to reach a desired cumulative GPA.

5.
Calculates how many additional units you must complete (based on your current CGPA/units and an assumed future GPA) to reach a desired cumulative GPA.

1. Select "C/GPA calculator" mode.  
2. Click "+ Add Course" for each course and enter the course units and letter grade.  
3. Make sure total units attempted come from your transcript (download from go.sfu.ca); do not include units in progress.  
4. Click "Calculate C/GPA."  
5. Note: repeats/duplicate courses are not handled—see an Academic Advisor; calculator is for SFU grades/units only.

9.
Let C = current CGPA, Uc = units completed, T = target CGPA, Un = additional units you will take, Greq = required GPA in those units.

Greq = (T*(Uc + Un) - C*Uc) / Un

(If instead you know the GPA you can achieve, Gexp, and want required units Un:)

Un = (T - C) * Uc / (Gexp - T)

10.
Let U = current units, C = current CGPA, T = target CGPA, g = expected GPA in future units, n = additional units required.

n = U*(T - C)/(g - T)

If T ≤ C then n = 0. If g ≤ T then impossible.

Using maximum possible grade M: n = U*(T - C)/(M - T)

11.
No. The GPA Calculator will not work if you have repeated/duplicate courses on your transcript; contact an Academic Advisor for help.

Numerical average for all terms completed.

Term GPA (term grade point average): numerical average for one term completed

15.
Log in at go.sfu.ca and download your transcript. Total units attempted does not include units in progress; it includes all units completed, including those given an F or N.

16.
No — it does not include units in progress.

17.
Yes — it includes units for courses graded F or N.

18.
No. GPA Calculators are intended for SFU grades and units only. Transfer students may need to include non‑SFU transfer courses and should contact an Academic Advisor for assistance.

19.
Some internal transfer GPAs are based on a set of specific courses and may require including non‑SFU transfer courses in the GPA calculation.
