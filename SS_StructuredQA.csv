How do you obtain one?
- Apply through Service Canada (online, by mail, or in person at a Service Canada Centre). You must submit original identity and immigration documents proving your legal status (e.g., Canadian birth certificate or citizenship card, permanent resident card, or a valid passport plus a study/work permit that authorizes employment).

To obtain an ITN you complete CRA Form T1261 (Application for a CRA Individual Tax Number for Non‑Residents), submit the form with original or certified copies of required identity documents (e.g. passport) per the form’s instructions, and mail them to the CRA’s International Tax Services Office (or follow the alternate submission instructions on the form).

The admission deposit is non‑refundable and non‑transferable; undergraduate admission deposits are $250 for Canadian students and $5,000 for international students; graduate deposit amounts and payment methods vary by program.

Admission deposit payments may initially appear under a different academic term but will automatically apply to the correct term once you are enrolled.

If you enroll and later decide to attend another institution or withdraw, drop all SFU courses as soon as possible to avoid being held responsible for outstanding tuition and fees.

Check your current outstanding balance on goSFU by going to Student Centre → Account Inquiry → Activity tab.

Tuition fees are due at the end of Week 2 each term; see Fees: payment and refunds for exact dates.

If your account still shows a charge after sending full payment, processing time through Flywire depends on the payment method chosen—see the Flywire processing table.

For available payment options see How to make a payment; paying electronically through your Canadian bank’s website is recommended—see Internet banking.

To make a payment from outside Canada, use Flywire—see Payments with Flywire.

Supplementary fees are assessed for all eligible students each term; if you see these fees you meet the criteria of an “eligible student.”

U‑Pass BC is mandatory for all members of the Simon Fraser Student Society (SFSS) and the Graduate Student Society (GSS); exemptions may be considered under specific criteria and must be applied for before the exemption deadline.

Supplementary fees are charged for remote courses because Student Services and Student Societies continue to provide support and offer programs and activities remotely and in person; contact SFSS or GSS with questions.",0_1_5_2,https://www.sfu.ca/students/enrolment-services/fees/how-to-pay.html

Where will the full exam schedule be posted?,"Over the past five undergraduate surveys, roughly one third of students said they could not enrol in a required course – and an exam conflict with another course ranked as one of the top three reasons. By producing the exam schedule after enrolment, we will eliminate enrolment/exam enrolment conflicts completely.

Previously, due to the early release, many departments scheduled exams “just in case”. As a result, each term nearly 20% of scheduled exams were cancelled or modified to a different format. That meant that 20% of available exam blocks were wasted. By changing to a later release, we’ll be able to use all of the exam blocks to the fullest extent possible, and spread exams more evenly.

Our goal is to reduce hardship through the entire student body, and we will be transparent with the results and numbers this new process produces as we move forward.

"What does the statistic ""Only one in six 25 year olds are pursuing the same job they thought they would do when they were 17"" mean for my career planning?","- Careers are fluid: expect your path to change and be prepared to adapt.

- Use your major as a foundation, not a box that limits possibilities.  
- Stay curious and explore multiple options through internships, volunteering, and side projects.  
- Treat career planning as iterative—try things, reflect, and adjust course regularly.  
- Build a network and conduct informational interviews to discover real-world roles and pathways.  
- Embrace small risks and experiments to gain clarity and practical experience.  
- Invest in continuous learning to keep up with changing industries and technologies.  
- Align choices with evolving values, interests, and strengths rather than fixed long-term plans.  
- Leverage career services and resources to test options and craft a flexible plan.",0_4_4_1,https://www.sfu.ca/students/career/explore.html

- Gives foundational knowledge you can apply across industries
- Opens pathways to related roles through industry-specific technical skills
- Enables specialization or pivoting with minors, electives, or certificates
- Serves as preparation for graduate/professional programs (law, business, medicine, etc.)
- Supports interdisciplinary careers by combining your major with other interests

Why should I avoid letting my major define my identity?,"- Your major is just one part of your story alongside skills, knowledge, values, and talents.  
- It limits the many career possibilities your degree can open.  
- Career interests and opportunities often change between 17 and 25 (and beyond).  
- Fixed planning assumes a predictable future, but technology, economy, climate, and politics create uncertainty.  
- You will change—your values, interests, abilities, and self‑view evolve over time.  
- Treating your major as identity reduces flexibility, creativity, and openness to new paths.  
- Careers aren’t linear; all situations are temporary and exploration can lead to better fits.

- Employer demand and hiring patterns may shift with the economy and industry trends.  
- Required skills may change — you may need to learn new technical or soft skills.  
- Your values, interests, and strengths may evolve, steering you toward different paths.  
- Internships, volunteer work, and part‑time roles may reveal unexpected careers.  
- Networking and informational interviews can open opportunities you hadn’t considered.

"Why do Career and Volunteer Services often get asked ""What can I do with my degree?""","- Because many students think their degree will define their identity and predict their job prospects.  
- Because some believe fixed planning guarantees success and expect a linear career path.  
- Because students expect that identifying an “ideal” career will determine the next five years.

- Create a portfolio of class projects, papers, prototypes, presentations, or a GitHub/website to demonstrate your work.
- Seek hands-on experience: internships, co-ops, part-time roles, volunteer work, or research assistantships.
- Conduct informational interviews and network to learn how employers apply your skills in different roles and industries.
- Use design-thinking: prototype career options, run short experiments (temp roles, freelance, shadowing) and iterate based on feedback.
- Tailor your resume and cover letters to highlight relevant skills and measurable outcomes for each role you apply to.
- Practice your personal pitch and storytelling that combines your major, skills, values, and what you want to contribute.
- Fill skill gaps with targeted courses, workshops, certifications, or self-directed learning.
- Find mentors, ask for feedback, and use campus career services and alumni connections to accelerate growth.
- Apply widely and stay open-minded—use early roles to gain experience and refine your career direction.

- External forces (technology, economy, climate, politics, societal shifts) change what work is possible and what you value.
- Exploring careers, taking risks, and networking expose you to new possibilities that reshape interests and goals.
- Personal growth (maturity, changing responsibilities, relationships) shifts priorities and life goals.
- Reflection and iteration (design thinking, info interviews, trial jobs) refine what feels meaningful and attainable.
- Your major becomes one part of your identity rather than its definition, allowing broader interests to emerge.
- Expectations adjust as you learn what work actually looks like; early assumptions often give way to new aspirations.
- Values may be clarified or reprioritized as you encounter ethical, environmental, or social issues that matter to you.
- Confidence and how you talk about yourself develop, changing how you see your strengths and career fit.
- Situations are temporary; openness and flexibility let your sense of self adapt to new roles and opportunities.",0_4_4_1,https://www.sfu.ca/students/career/explore.html
How do I balance what I want to do with the work that needs doing in the world?,"1. Clarify your values, interests, strengths, and talents — what matters to you and what energizes you.  
2. Research the work that needs doing: industries, societal problems, and labour-market trends.  
3. Map the overlap: identify roles and problems where your strengths meet real-world needs.  
4. Use design thinking: frame questions like “What challenges do I want to tackle?” and prototype solutions.  
5. Take small risks and iterate: do informational interviews, short projects, volunteering, or internships.  
6. Build transferable skills (communication, problem‑solving, collaboration, tech) that apply across roles.  
7. Network and seek mentors to get clues, feedback, and opportunities you wouldn’t see alone.  
8. Choose experiences that let you make contributions now while keeping options open for change.  
9. Practice talking about your story and impact clearly so employers and collaborators understand your value.

What does the text mean by expectations looking different from the truth?,"- Because the future is uncertain (technology, the economy, climate, political and social change can alter job prospects).  
- Because you will change over time—your values, interests, abilities, and sense of self may shift.  
- Because a major or early plan doesn’t rigidly determine your career; degrees open multiple possibilities.  
- Because career paths aren’t linear and fixed planning often won’t match how things actually unfold.  
- It doesn’t mean worse—just different; you’ll need to adapt, explore, and reassess.",0_4_4_1,https://www.sfu.ca/students/career/explore.html

Why are all situations considered good and temporary in career development?,"- Because careers and life aren’t linear — roles and paths change over time.  
- Because external factors (technology, economy, climate, politics) make the future uncertain and circumstances shift.  
- Because your values, interests, abilities and identity will evolve as you grow.  
- Because each situation offers learning and stepping-stones, not a permanent definition of you.  
- Because multiple options exist and you can revisit or change choices as you gain experience.  
- Because taking small risks and iterating creates new possibilities, so the current state won’t last.",0_4_4_1,https://www.sfu.ca/students/career/explore.html
What does it mean that careers and life aren’t linear?,"- Career paths don’t follow a single predictable route; people change roles, interests, and goals over time.

What is Design Thinking and how does it apply to defining my career?,"Design Thinking — definition
- A human-centered, solution-based, iterative approach for solving complex, unclear problems. Core phases: empathize (understand people/needs), define (frame the problem), ideate (generate many options), prototype (build low‑cost experiments), and test (learn and refine).

How it applies to defining your career
- Treat your career as a design challenge: you don’t need a single fixed answer; you explore and iterate.
- Empathize with yourself and the market: clarify your values, skills, interests, and the needs/opportunities in workplaces.
- Define a focused question (e.g., “What kinds of work let me solve X problem and use Y skills?”).
- Ideate broadly: list many possible roles, industries, and pathways without judging them.
- Prototype quickly and cheaply: do info interviews, short internships, volunteer roles, freelance projects, part‑time jobs, or shadowing to test options.
- Test and learn: reflect on what you enjoyed, what fit, and what didn’t; use that feedback to refine your next experiments.
- Repeat iteratively: small risks and continual learning build clarity, flexibility, and new possibilities for your career.",0_4_4_1,https://www.sfu.ca/students/career/explore.html

"What does having the ""perfect"" course load mean?","Finding a course load that gives you balance in life both on and off-campus while you pursue your academic, professional, and personal goals—choosing what’s right for your needs rather than a “perfect” number.",0_5_1_1,https://www.sfu.ca/students/mysfuplan/academic-planning/know.html
How should I determine the right course load for my needs?,"- Clarify your learning objectives and degree requirements (units, prerequisites, and timeline for completion)
- Balance academic, professional and personal goals so your course load supports life on and off campus
- Assess your current life circumstances (work, family, health, commute) and realistic weekly time for study
- Start with a manageable number of units and allow flexibility to adjust as your needs evolve
- Give yourself time before enrolling each term to reassess priorities and plans
- Consult an Academic Advisor for personalized guidance and to see the bigger picture",0_5_1_1,https://www.sfu.ca/students/mysfuplan/academic-planning/know.html
Why should I allow flexibility in my course plans before enrolling each term?,"- Because your learning objectives, educational path, and life circumstances can change over time.  
- Because plans for degree completion may shift, requiring different courses or pacing.  
- Because flexibility helps you find a balanced course load that supports academic, professional, and personal goals.  
- Because giving yourself time allows better decision‑making before enrolling each term.  
- Because advisors can help you adjust plans to fit the bigger picture.",0_5_1_1,https://www.sfu.ca/students/mysfuplan/academic-planning/know.html
"How can my learning objectives, educational path and life circumstances affect my course load?","Learning objectives:
- Aiming for deeper mastery (research, capstone, honors) may require more advanced, time‑intensive courses or fewer courses to focus on depth.
- Seeking breadth or multiple minors/certificates may increase the number of courses per term.
- Needing specific skills (labs, studios, internships) can change the type and workload of courses you choose.

Educational path:
- Degree requirements, major/minor changes or adding credentials can raise or shift your course load to meet required credits.
- Course sequencing and prerequisites may force lighter or heavier terms depending on what’s available when.
- Transfer credits, co-op or study‑abroad plans can accelerate or delay course load in certain terms.

Life circumstances:
- Employment, caregiving, health or financial responsibilities may require a reduced (part‑time) course load.
- Personal commitments, commuting or relocation affect how many and what kind of courses you can manage.
- Mental health or unexpected events may necessitate flexibility and temporary adjustments to course load.",0_5_1_1,https://www.sfu.ca/students/mysfuplan/academic-planning/know.html

- Taking more courses per term can shorten time to degree and may reduce total tuition and living costs overall.  
- Spreading courses over more terms lowers per‑term expenses but can increase total tuition, living costs and delay graduation.  
- Full‑time vs part‑time status (and related fee structures) affects eligibility for financial aid, scholarships and benefits, so it influences how many courses you can afford to take.

What is the difference between a resume and a curriculum vitae (CV)?,"Ask yourself (quick checklist)
- What exact roles do I want long-term, and do those roles explicitly require a graduate degree or professional credential?
- What skills or experience am I missing that prevent me from getting those roles now?
- Do I prefer academic/research work or applied/professional work?
- Can I afford tuition and time away from paid work? Are there funding/scholarship options?
- How strong is my academic record for admission? Do I have potential referees?
- Do I need to switch fields, or deepen expertise in my current field?
- Am I ready for 1–3+ years of full-time study, or would part-time/online study be better?

How to interpret your answers
- If your target jobs require a master’s/PhD or research credentials (e.g., academia, certain clinical/research roles), prioritize graduate school.
- If employers value applied skills, certifications, or hands‑on experience (e.g., tech, project management, many industry roles), short courses, certificates, bootcamps, or targeted training + work experience are often higher ROI.
- If you’re unsure, gain 6–12 months of relevant work or volunteer experience first — this clarifies interests and strengthens future applications.
- If funding, time, or admission competitiveness are major barriers, consider part‑time/online graduate programs or micro‑credentials as intermediate steps.
- If you have a strong research interest and potential supervisors at programs you like, that’s a good sign to apply.

Alternatives to immediate grad school
- Professional certificates, microcredentials, bootcamps
- Short courses and online learning (Coursera, edX, industry providers)
- Internships, co‑ops, volunteer roles, contract work
- Professional designations or licensure relevant to your field
- Part‑time or bridging master’s programs, or post‑baccalaureate diplomas

Practical comparison points (use when choosing)
- Cost and funding (stipend, scholarship, employer sponsorship)
- Time to completion and opportunity cost of lost earnings
- Career outcomes and typical salaries after completion
- Admission requirements and your competitiveness
- Mode of delivery (in‑person vs online vs part‑time)
- Networking and experiential learning opportunities

Next steps (actionable)
- Scan job ads in your target field to see what credentials employers list.
- Do 3–5 informational interviews with people in roles you want.
- Try a short online course to test interest and build skills.
- If considering research grad school, contact potential supervisors and ask about projects and funding.
- If considering professional training, compare curricula, industry recognition, and alumni outcomes.
- Book a 1:1 with a Career Educator at SFU (myExperience) to review goals, CV, and options — bring your CV and sample job postings. You can also call 778-782-3106 or email careers@sfu.ca.

- Enter variable monthly costs (food, transit, entertainment) and adjust amounts to reflect realistic usage.
- Add one-time and occasional expenses using the “+ Add other fixed and variable monthly expenses” option.
- Provide as much detail as possible—the more you enter, the more accurate the estimate for the single academic term (four months).
- Review the calculator’s term total and use it to set spending limits for each category; mark non-negotiable (fixed) vs discretionary (variable) items.
- Identify areas to trim (use student discounts, free on‑campus services) and re-run the calculator after adjustments.
- If cashflow is an issue, consider SFU’s Payment Plan (installments with 2% monthly interest) and factor that into your budget.

Enrolment in a Co-op work term is considered equivalent to full‑time study; students may apply for In‑Study Payment‑Free (Interest‑Free) status but must request it (does not happen automatically).

Students must submit a request for confirmation of enrolment term‑by‑term via their NSLSC portal.

Students enrolled only in an SFU Co‑op work term (3‑unit, non‑graded) are not eligible for scholarships/awards/bursaries administered by Financial Aid and Awards.

Students enrolled in an SFU International Co‑op work term are eligible to apply for SFU International Co‑op Education Bursaries and Awards.

How should I separate and think about fixed costs versus variable costs when budgeting?,"- Fixed costs: expenses that stay the same or change rarely—build these into your baseline budget as “must-pay” each month/term. Examples: tuition and mandatory fees, rent, insurance, loan payments, some subscription plans, and recurring program fees.

- Variable costs: expenses that fluctuate with use and choices—treat these as flexible categories you can cut or expand. Examples: groceries and dining out, transportation and gas, utilities if usage-based, books and supplies, entertainment, clothing, personal items.

- How to use them together: total your fixed costs first to establish the minimum amount you must cover each term; then allocate the remainder to variable categories with realistic limits.

- Budgeting tips: track actual spending to set accurate allowances; decide which variable items are essentials vs “nice-to-have”; build a small buffer for irregular or one-time costs (laptop, travel home); look for student discounts and on‑campus resources to reduce costs; revisit and adjust your variable limits each term.",0_5_3_4,https://www.sfu.ca/students/mysfuplan/financial-planning.html

The obligation to accommodate is mandatory, not discretionary, and the University must accommodate up to the point of undue hardship.

We accommodate because the BC Human Rights Code prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion, so employers and public institutions have a legal duty to provide equal access and opportunities for people of different faiths. Accommodation prevents religious discrimination and supports inclusivity, subject only to the high legal threshold of undue hardship.",0_6_5_9,https://www.sfu.ca/students/multifaith/resources/accommodation.html

How do I request religious accommodation from my professor or employer?,"What is religious accommodation?
Religious accommodation is the right to have your religious practices (e.g., time away from or modifications to work or study to observe holy days or rites) accommodated by employers and public-service providers (such as universities). The obligation to accommodate is mandatory, not discretionary, and applies up to the point of undue hardship.

Why do we accommodate?
We accommodate because the B.C. Human Rights Code prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion; accommodating ensures equal access and fair treatment. Accommodation must be provided unless it would cause undue hardship (assessed case-by-case by factors like cost, workforce disruption, and impact on others).",0_6_5_9,https://www.sfu.ca/students/multifaith/resources/accommodation.html

We accommodate because the B.C. Human Rights Code prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion; institutions like the University must provide equal access and respect for religious diversity.

What kinds of changes can religious accommodation involve?,"- It means the University/employer is legally required to make reasonable adjustments for religious practices unless doing so would cause undue hardship — it cannot simply refuse as a matter of choice.

- The duty is mandatory under the B.C. Human Rights Code; accommodation must be pursued in good faith and assessed case-by-case.

- The institution bears the burden to show undue hardship (e.g., excessive cost, major workforce disruption, or significant impact on others) before refusing accommodation.

- Practically, this prohibits penalizing or ignoring bona fide accommodation requests and requires proactive, reasonable solutions (e.g., rescheduling, alternate deadlines) where possible.",0_6_5_9,https://www.sfu.ca/students/multifaith/resources/accommodation.html
What are examples of accommodations when a student needs to be absent on a recognized holy day?,"Religious accommodation is the right to have one’s religious practices (e.g., time away or modifications to work/study to follow faith tenets) accommodated by employers and public service providers. We accommodate because discrimination on the basis of religion is prohibited under the B.C. Human Rights Code; institutions like the University have a mandatory duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. To request it, students/employees should notify their professor or employer as early as possible.

Accommodation can take many forms depending on the request: excusal from classes or exams for recognized holy days with opportunity to make up work, rescheduling or moving exams, extended time, breaks for prayer or to break fast, alternative assignment deadlines, or other adjustments. There is no legal duty to accommodate optional or purely social faith-based events.

Undue hardship is the legal limit to accommodation — accommodation must be provided unless it would create unduly onerous conditions. Determination is case-by-case and considers factors such as cost relative to the institution’s budget, disruption to the workforce, and impact on other students/employees; short notice can increase risk of undue hardship. Undue hardship is a high threshold and rarely met.

Yes — there is a difference between days of religious and cultural significance. Some culturally significant celebrations (e.g., Chinese New Year) may be important and the University may grant time off, but there is no automatic legal requirement to accommodate purely cultural observances in the same way as religious holy days.",0_6_5_9,https://www.sfu.ca/students/multifaith/resources/accommodation.html
What kinds of accommodations might be available within classes or during exams?,"1. Submit your request to your professor or employer as early as possible (contact them as soon as you know of the need).  
2. Check important dates (class, exams — exam schedule released Week 7) and note when your religious holidays occur.  
3. Be open and specific about the accommodation you are asking for and be willing to work on a solution.  
4. Follow up the conversation promptly with a thank-you email that includes: your name and ID, class code, relevant date(s), what you discussed, and a recap of the accommodation requested.  
5. If you need help preparing the request, consult the Multifaith Centre or Human Rights Office.  
6. If your request is denied, contact the Human Rights Office to have it reviewed.

Is undue hardship easy for the University to establish?,"Religious accommodation is the right of a person to have their religious practices accommodated by employers and providers of public services and facilities (such as universities).

Requests should be made to a professor or employer as early as possible. The obligation to accommodate is mandatory, not discretionary, up to the point of undue hardship.

We accommodate because the B.C. Human Rights Code prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion and requires institutions to provide accommodation unless doing so would cause undue hardship.

"What advice is given to students about planning around religious events, classes, exams, and assignments?","What is religious accommodation?
""Religious accommodation"" is the right to have one’s religious practices accommodated by employers and providers of public services and facilities (such as universities). It can include schedule changes, time away from work or study, or other modifications so a person can observe the tenets of their faith. The obligation to accommodate is mandatory (not discretionary) and applies up to the point of undue hardship.

Why do we accommodate?
We accommodate because the B.C. Human Rights Code prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion and requires employers and public institutions to make reasonable accommodations. Accommodation ensures equal access to education and employment, respects religious freedom and diversity, and must be provided unless doing so would cause undue hardship (a high legal threshold).",0_6_5_9,https://www.sfu.ca/students/multifaith/resources/accommodation.html
How should a professor or staff member respond when a student approaches them for religious accommodation?,"- Undue hardship is reached when accommodating a religious practice would create unduly onerous conditions for the University.  
- It is determined on a case‑by‑case basis.  
- Factors considered include cost (relative to the University’s overall budget), disruption of the workforce, and the effect on other students and employees.  
- Leaving too little time to make an accommodation can be a significant factor in finding undue hardship.

We accommodate because the B.C.

Are there certain times of the year that are busier for religious accommodation requests?,"- Short notice limits practical options (e.g., finding alternate exam times, covering classes, or reallocating work), making feasible solutions harder or impossible.  
- It increases logistical and administrative burden and potential costs (e.g., hiring proctors, arranging rooms or makeup assessments) on short notice.  
- It heightens disruption to other students, staff, or the instructor’s schedule, so accommodating would more likely create onerous conditions.",0_6_5_9,https://www.sfu.ca/students/multifaith/resources/accommodation.html
