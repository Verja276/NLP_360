The SFU Food Pantry launched in February 2022 to support SFU’s food insecure student population with emergency top-up food and hygiene supplies.

We are open every Wednesday (except statutory holidays), from 12:30pm - 3:00pm. Please bring a grocery bag, as well as reusable containers to receive items such as rice, flour, and oats. The Pantry will provide up to 10 pounds/5 kilograms of fresh and dry food based on availability.
