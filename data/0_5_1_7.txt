Budgeting can help you manage your student finances at university. To start, think about various costs you might incur during your undergraduate studies. Then take some time to consider the obvious (and not so obvious) costs in your life and use our cost calculator in the next section.

Fixed costs vs variable costs—what's the difference?

Fixed costs are expenses that don’t change very often, so you can expect to pay the same dollar amount month-by-month or term-by-term, over the next year or so. Compared to variable costs, think of fixed costs as somewhat “non-negotiable” in terms of how they fit into your budget.

 

Examples of your fixed costs:


Variable costs are expenses that can go up or down, depending on how much you consume or use something. Compared to fixed costs, variable costs have less predictabiliy, but daily life is full of them—think of essential and "nice-to-have" purchases and services that can add up.

 

Examples of your variable costs:


With that in mind, consider all your fixed and variable costs together and try to decide on things you can and can't do without—it'll help you make practical decisions about your budget. By sticking to your game plan, you'll be able to predict and be better prepared to cover your expenses.

Food security is a valid concern for many university students across Canada, as food and grocery costs can quickly add up. Take advantage of these on-campus food resources:

With your fixed and variable costs in mind, it’s now time to crunch some numbers! Take some time to fill out the form—the more details you provide, the more closely the results will reflect your actual costs. Please keep in mind that the calculator only provides an estimate for a single academic term (i.e. four months) and is not intended to calculate exact dollar amounts.

Use this as a starting point to plan your finances and set expectations for each term of your undergraduate studies at SFU.
