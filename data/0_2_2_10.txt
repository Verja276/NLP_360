A student with a disability is eligible to receive institutionally administered financial aid funding managed by the Financial Aid and Awards Office, if the student is enrolled in a minimum of 6 or more units of standard graded courses and meets all other eligibility requirements. The student has to provide a letter from SFU’s Centre for Accessible Learning (CAL) confirming that the student is registered with the Centre (CAL).

In addition to a variety of financial resources available to all SFU students, students with a disability may be eligible for additional grants and/or bursaries available through the federal and provincial governments (see below). For other resources, please download External Awards and Additional Resources for Students with Disabilities
