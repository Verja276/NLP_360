Burnaby, Surrey, Online, Faith Gathering, Prayer, The Point, ENM

When Christians gather together for weekly worship, their act of coming together creates what they call "church." While together, they have singing and worship, they listen to the readings of the Bible, preaching from the pastor, and celebrate the love and life of Jesus.
