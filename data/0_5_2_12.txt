What is Food Security?
The Food and Agriculture Organization defines food security as "all people, at all times, [having] physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritous food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life."

Programs that deliver affordable food to SFU community on and off campus. 

Programs that make food more accessible, including communication around all the available programs for students and how to access them without the social stigma.

More classes, programs, workshops, drop-in sessions or similar should be offered to increase student food utilization skills (the knowledge of how to purchase, prepare and use food).

The SFU Pantry is a food bank for students in need of emergency food and hygiene supplies. Bring your own grocery bag and collect perishable and non-perishable items based on your preference. They are open Wednesdays from 12-3pm on the lower level of MBC. Bring your student ID! 

The Pantry is made possible through the generous support of the Burnaby Neighbourhood House, Greater Vancouver Food Bank, United Way of the Lower Mainland, Food Banks Canada, Ancillary Services and the SFU Office of Community Engagement!
