Space in Simon Fraser University courses is limited and tuition refunds and penalties are designed to discourage a student from holding space in courses(s) which the student eventually does not use.

When students who are enrolled in credit courses reduce the number of courses in which they are enrolled, a refund may be granted provided the course change is made during the prescribed refund period. Special fees are not refundable, with the exception of the graduation fee and award of certificate or diploma fee. The table below applies to classes that follow the regular, full-term schedule. Intersession and Summer Session classes will have different deadline dates for refunds.

This term's course drop deadlines are available here.

Information related to appeal criteria and eligibility is available on the Tuition Refund Request page.
