Working while completing your undergraduate studies is an opportunity to not only earn income that can help pay for your tuition, but also a way for you to explore future career paths with the degree you're pursuing.

Additionally, volunteering can help you network with people in your field, while giving you an opportunity to develop new skills and gain relevant experience.

To help you get started on your search, we've curated a list of opportunities available to students. You'll find many job and volunteer postings both on and off campus through the links below. Use this resource as a starting point for the different possibilities your SFU degree can lead you to!
