Students in the Surrey cohorts, specifically those in IAT One and the Beedie School of Business at the Surrey campus, are required to be enrolled in their core courses each term of the cohort program. For more information on how to enrol in Surrey courses or if you have any concerns about your enrolment, please refer to the enrolment guidelines or speak with your cohort advisor.

If you have a requirement to be a “full-time” student, you will need to enrol in at least nine units (typically three courses). However, 15 units (typically five courses) is generally considered a “full course load”.

At SFU, you are free to enrol in any course you wish, provided you meet the prerequisites and there are no further restrictions on the course. In general, students enrol in one (1) to five (5) courses per term.
