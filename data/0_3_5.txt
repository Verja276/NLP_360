The GPA Calculator will help you anticipate how many units or what GPA you need to achieve a desired CGPA. However, if you have a repeat of a course in your transcript, the GPA Calculator will not work. For assistance on recalculating your GPA with repeats, please see an Academic Advisor.

Learn about the standard grading system and see the numeric value of each letter grade or learn how to manually calculate your grade point average.
