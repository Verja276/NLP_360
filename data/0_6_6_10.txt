Whether you are reaching out about your own experience or reporting conduct you’ve witnessed in class, our office is here to support you.

Please provide your name and preferred contact information so the appropriate staff can follow-up with you as needed. Our staff will aim to get back to you within one business day.

There are several student support services in place to guide you through difficult situations and where possible, provide further protection from harm. In some cases, we may recommend a report be submitted to a specific support office, and next steps will be reinforced through SFU policies and procedures.

If you or someone you know are in immediate danger, call 911.
