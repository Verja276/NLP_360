Welcome Guides

Congratulations on your admission to SFU.

Our Welcome Guides offer a step-by-step guide for new international students coming to SFU including checklists of what to do before and after you start at SFU.

All new international undergraduate and graduate students beginning their studies at SFU this Spring 2026 are invited to our multi-part orientation series to get transition support and make connections.
