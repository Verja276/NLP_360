Parents and Guardians


Appointments must be made at least two days in advance, excluding weekends. 

Our appointments can be scheduled Monday through Friday, excluding statutory holidays. We will do our best to accomodate your request, however, your requested day and time may already reserved for another student and we will do our best to provide alternatives.  You are also welcome to reach out by phone or to attend one of our virtual, drop-in advising sessions if you have urgent questions.

If you are an incoming student for Fall, most government student financial assistance applications open in June each year.

Please sign in through Advisor Link to book an in-person or virtual advising session with an Advisor from your success team.  Requests through our online form will be declined for current students.

Please select your preferred date and time with at least two business days to confirm your request.
