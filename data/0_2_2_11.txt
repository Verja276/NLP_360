Notes and exceptions:

1 Tuition fees at the 200 level and above offered by the Faculty of Business Administration, the School of Computing Science, and the School of Engineering Science are higher than normal course tuition fees: see Undergraduate tuition fees.

2 Supplementary fees include the U-Pass (Universal Transit Pass), Student Services and Recreation-Athletics fees, and the Student Activity Fee. The Student Activity fee includes an average, per-term cost of the Build SFU Levy as it increases yearly on January 1.

3 Student Society Health and Dental plan fees are normally paid each September for the entire academic year (September - August). As a student studying in the Province of British Columbia, the Medical Services Plan (health fee) for international students, MSP, is paid directly to the government and has been included here as a cost incurred for students in a given term. New International Students are required to have short term primary medical insurance under guard.me@sfu in an SFU undergraduate, graduate or exchange program until they are eligible for coverage through MSP and this cost has not been included in these typical costs. Find more information on our Medical Insurance FAQ. Additional costs may apply.  

4 The estimated international graduate student costs are based on regular program tuition and fees. Graduate tuition fees vary between regular and speciality programs

5 A books and supplies amount is provided as a guideline of how much to budget for books and supplies each term, including an amount built in to contribute to the purchase of appropriate technology once per degree program.
