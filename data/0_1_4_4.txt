Please go to your browser’s preferences and enable cookies to proceed with using the U-Pass BC website. TransLink's privacy policy, available on their website, provides more information on cookies.

It can take up to 24 hours for your U-Pass BC to be loaded onto your Compass Card, so make sure you request your U-Pass BC at least the day before the end of the month. Without a valid U-Pass BC on your Compass Card, you are responsible for paying your transit fare.

You will need to log into the U-Pass BC website each month to request your monthly U-Pass BC be loaded onto your Compass Card. You will be able to request your next month's U-Pass BC starting on the 16th of the current month.
