Tuesday Night Fellowship (TNF) is a place to worship, hang out, and learn together through a short teaching from the Bible. 

TNF is a great place to build authentic friendships, learn about God, and grow in your faith. If you are interested in spirituality, this is a great place to explore the Christian faith and make great friends. 

Tuesday Night Fellowship is open to all SFU students.
