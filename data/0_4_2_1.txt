For more information about Co-op Practicum Tuition, please visit the sections for Undergraduate Students or Graduate Students.

As part of enrolment into the SFU Co-operative Education program, every student who applies must pay the application fee when they first join. 

Your application form will be processed within ten business days. Once processed, the Co-op application fee will be posted to your goSFU Account.  

You are responsible for paying the practicum tuition only when you have secured a work term. This tuition must be paid every term you are working in a co-op position.

You can apply to the Co-op Program at any time throughout the year. Your application will be placed in the next 7-week cohort preparation course based on when you submit it. It is recommended that you apply to the Co-op Program at least two terms before you plan to start your first work term. This will allow you sufficient time to complete the preparation courses, apply, and interview for available positions. 

Once you apply, you will gain access to the Co-op Orientation course and will be enrolled in the 7-week Co-op Prep course at the start of the cohort. This course will prepare you for the application and interview processes needed to secure a work term. Below are the application deadlines for the Co-op Program.
