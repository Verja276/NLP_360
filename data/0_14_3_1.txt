If your department has suffered a loss in regards to SFU work or an SFU sanctioned event, you may be able to submit a claim for reimbursement through SFU's insurance program.

In the event you are not ready to make a claim but wish to notify us of an incident, please email risk_srs@sfu.ca  and provide the following:

If SFU owned, rented, leased, or borrowed equipment is damaged or stolen, your department can submit a claim to recuperate some or all of the replacement costs. A $1,000 deductible may apply in most cases; however, this is dependent on the circumstances of the loss and at the discretion of Risk Management.
