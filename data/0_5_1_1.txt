Your course load is the total number of units determined by the courses you're enrolled in for a given term. For example:

Having the "perfect" course load simply means finding one that gives you balance in life both on and off-campus as you pursue your academic, professional and personal goals. Instead of finding the perfect number, consider what's right for your needs!

Recognize that your learning objectives, educational path and even life circumstances can evolve throughout your studies—and your plans for degree completion can change along with them. Give yourself some time and allow a bit of flexibility in your plans before enrolling in courses each term.
