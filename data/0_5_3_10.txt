Global Student Centre

A space for all things global, intercultural, and international at Simon Fraser University. The Global Student Centre (GSC) is the campus hub for creating intercultural connections and sharing your international student experience.

We open our doors during the week so you may use our GSC lounge to take a break, enjoy free snacks, meet fellow students, or have focused study time. Check our calendar to find out what's happening at the GSC.
