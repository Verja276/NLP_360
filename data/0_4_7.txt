HOW TO REQUEST A LOCKER IN THE SUB:

The club lockers in the SUB are available for requesting during the summer semester!

Starting in May, you can request the club lockers through the Club Portal. Executives with fund/facilities authority can request using the “Renew/Request Locker” link under the “Club Management Tools & Forms” section.

The available lockers will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis, but it is not guaranteed that you will get one due to limited supply. Groups that are allocated alternate storage space by other departments on campus are not eligible for a SUB locker. (E.g. groups that have common rooms, other lockers, or storage).

Please note that “club lockers” refer to the lockers located in the Student Union Building (SUB) on Level 1000 and 2000. They are different from the lockers that are rented through SFU Recreation.

Any group that is assigned a locker must adhere to the SFSS Student Union Building Locker Guidelines.
