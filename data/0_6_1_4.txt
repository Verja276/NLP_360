This toolkit contains guides and resources related to all things accessibility and is available to all faculty, staff, and students. It is very important to consider the experiences of those living with disabilities, particularly if our existing environments, services, products, communication, and practices create barriers to accessibility. Considering accessibility when developing environments, services, products, and practices is essential for mitigating accessibility barriers on campus. We hope that these resources will facilitate the design of accessible and inclusive experiences on campus.

Please note that this toolkit is primarily intended for informational and educational purposes. The externally linked resources contained within this toolkit do not necessarily reflect the views, policies and/or practices of the Centre for Accessible Learning or of Simon Fraser University.
