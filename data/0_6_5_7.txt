Join Jummah on Fridays at SFU with the Muslim Students Association. Jummah is open to students, staff, and faculty.

Attendance is drop-in style; no registration needed.

When Muslims congregate for congregational devotion during Friday midday prayer, it is known as “Jummah.” The time includes the Dhuhr (midday) prayer, a "Khutbah" or message by an Imam, and a Iqamma, the second call to prayer to conclude.
