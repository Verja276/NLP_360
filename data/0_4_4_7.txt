We provide sessions, resources, conversations and opportunities to offer transformative experiences, support aspirations and educate on career development strategies. We promote inclusive and accessible spaces that foster confidence in work or volunteer positions, career, life and student life. 

Find Your Why.   Tell Your Story.   Get Career Ready.

Book a session for your class, club, student union, professional development gathering, or working group! 

Our sessions are open to ALL students at SFU (undergraduate, graduate and new alumni) and are facilitated by professional Career Education Specialists from our award-winning office, or by our specially trained Career Peers.

To book a session, please submit our online webform at least four weeks in advance of desired dates. We may require a minimum group size to proceed. You will be responsible for event promotion and room bookings or virtual links.
