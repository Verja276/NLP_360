Space in Simon Fraser University courses is limited. Tuition refunds and penalties are designed to discourage a student from holding space in courses(s) which the student eventually decides not to take. When students who are enrolled in credit courses reduce the number of courses in which they are enrolled, a refund may be granted provided the course change is made during the prescribed refund period. Special fees are not refundable, with the exception of the graduation fee and award of certificate or diploma fee.

An outline of course drop deadlines is available at www.sfu.ca/students/deadlines.html.

The Regular Term Tuition Refund table applies to classes that follow the regular, full-term schedule. Intersession and Summer session classes will have different deadline dates for refunds.

To obtain a refund due to an overpayment, students must submit a refund request. Visit https://www.sfu.ca/students/enrolment-services/fees/refunds.html to obtain the refund request form.

Students with overdue accounts will be considered to be in bad financial standing and will be precluded from enrolling in subsequent terms. In addition, the university will withhold certain services, including but not limited to the release of various letters and documents such as official transcripts of academic record and parchments for degrees, diplomas and certificates. An account that is delinquent without approved resolution will be forwarded to a collection agency for appropriate action.

A student who presents payment in the form of a cheque that is subsequently returned by the student’s financial institution for lack of sufficient funds or because a stop payment has been placed on that cheque will be assessed a penalty fee of $30. In the event that a student on more than one occasion submits a cheque that is dishonoured for any reason, the university reserves the right to require all future financial transactions with the university to be certified cheque or money order. The university may cancel a student’s enrollment in a term when payments made by the student are subsequently dishonoured by the student’s financial institution. Monthly interest charges will apply.

Students with overdue accounts will be assessed a monthly interest charge on outstanding fees. 2% will be assessed each month on the outstanding balance, regardless of any pending scholarships, bursaries, awards, tuition waivers and tuition fee credits certificates. Total penalties will be adjusted to conform to Canadian laws and regulations when the final payment is made.

Back to Top

If the candidate’s application for a degree, certificate and/or diploma is not approved, a full refund is issued. Applications may not be transferred from one term to another and the required fee must accompany each application.
