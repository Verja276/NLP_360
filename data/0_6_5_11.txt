F T I

This blog aims to nurture well-being, amplify student voices, share interesting finds, and explore what faith looks like in different traditions. 

We hope to foster meaningful perspectives around faith and spirituality, which can be sensitive topics. However, by sharing knowledge and experiences we hope to foster understanding, bridge gaps, dispel misconceptions, and promote inclusivity. Whether you’re simply curious, a skeptic, or a person of faith, our goal is to engage you in thought-provoking stories and ideas about faith.
