All hazards must be reported. Every employee must be aware of reporting procedures.

Report urgent hazards to the Campus Security Emergency Line: 778.782.4500.
Examples of situations requiring immediate action include: a suspicious package, a gas or chemical smell, suspicious person, etc.

This applies to non-emergency situations (e.g. blocked emergency evacuation routes, workstation ergonomics, indoor air quality issues, etc.).

Report all hazards to your supervisor who is responsible for investigating and initiating appropriate action.

If your supervisor fails to address your perceived hazard, contact your local joint safety committee or Environmental Health and Safety at ehrs_sfu@sfu.ca. 

This applies in situations outside of a department (e.g. in a hallway, classroom, lecture theatre, cafeteria, stairwell, access routes, outdoor areas) and includes circumstances such as broken steps, damaged seats, protruding branches, poor lighting, damaged railings, etc.

Contact Environmental Health and Safety for assistance at ehrs_sfu@sfu.ca.
