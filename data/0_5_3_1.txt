Various experiences shape our identities and influence our sense of belonging, support, and community connection. Below is a list of resources that support both individual and collective identities. This list is not exhaustive but will be updated as we expand our identity-based resources on and off campus.

SFU students can connect with My SSP and request to make an appointment with a culturally relevant counsellor. Black Student Support and Healing Space is a safe and confidential space for racialized students to share their stories, learn from each other, and build community.
