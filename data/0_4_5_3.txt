Peer Mentorship programs provide incoming students with peer-to-peer support and guidance during their first year at SFU. The programs below match Mentors (third and fourth year students) with Mentees (first year students) within their faculty or department. Mentors help their Mentees navigate their first year of university through one-on-one support and other social events organized by the mentorship programs.
