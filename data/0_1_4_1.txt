The U-Pass BC Program is a transportation package which provides students in Metro Vancouver with universal and affordable access to public transit. The Program is a partnership between Simon Fraser University, the Simon Fraser Student Society (SFSS), the Graduate Student Society (GSS), TransLink, and the Province of British Columbia and was approved through SFSS and GSS referendum.

SFU's U-Pass BC Program is a mandatory program for all eligible members of the SFSS and the GSS. The U-Pass BC Program provides unlimited, all zone access to public transit in Metro Vancouver including TransLink Bus, SkyTrain, and SeaBus services and a discount on West Coast Express Train fares. Current TransLink transit service schedules and maps are available online.
