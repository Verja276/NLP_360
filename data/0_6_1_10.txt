SFU is committed to the full participation of students with disabilities in all aspects of academic life. The CAL supports such equal participation by coordinating the provision of reasonable academic accommodations and services for students with disabilities.

If you are a prospective student, we recommend contacting our CAL office to discuss your disability-related needs. We can provide information to help you decide whether or not to attend SFU. 

If you are a new student who has accepted your offer to SFU, please contact us as soon as possible to schedule an appointment with a CAL Disability Access Advisor. They'll introduce you to resources and services around campus and begin registering you with our office. Even if you are not eligible for academic accommodations or disability-related services, they can direct you to other helpful resources around campus.
