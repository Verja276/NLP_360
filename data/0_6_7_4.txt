Someone who has experienced sexual violence may disclose their experience to any member of the campus community. Often they will choose to disclose to someone they trust. The response of the person they first disclose to can have a profound impact on the survivor's decision to continue to seek support or not.  

A formal report to SFU can only be made to the Sexual Violence Support & Prevention Office (SVSPO). A formal report is made for the purposes of initiating a process under policy GP 44 Sexual Violence and Misconduct. The Sexual Violence Support & Prevention Office can receive both disclosures for the purpose of accessing support and formal reports.
