US undergraduate and graduate students requiring financial assistance have several options to explore while studying at Simon Fraser University (SFU).

US students are eligible to apply for a variety of SFU Financial Aid Programs (bursaries, scholarships, awards, and/or Work-Study).

If you are a dual citizen of Canada and the United States, you may be eligible to apply for loan(s) through both the Canadian (with the exception of Ontario Student Assistance Program) and US government. We recommend that you explore opportunities through the Canada Student Loans program first. Contact Financial Aid and Awards for more information.

The US Federal Direct Loan Application package is available here.
