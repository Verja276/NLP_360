Do you have questions about faith? Are you looking for spiritual direction? Or you just want somone to listen?

Chaplains are here to connect with you.

At the Multifaith Centre we are here to provide faith care and wellbeing support to our students, staff, and faculty. Faith care, also called "pastoral care," is an ancient model of emotional, social and spiritual support that can be found in all cultures and traditions. The term is considered inclusive of distinctly non-religious forms of support, as well as support for people from religious communities. 


Chaplain Chat and Support is a time to connect one on one with a chaplain. We seek to offer faith care by being a listening ear regardless of religion, race, colour, ancestry, place of origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or age. Chaplains are open to meeting with all members of the SFU community, and are open to connecting with you.

You can book an appointment with a Chaplain online or you can contact us.
