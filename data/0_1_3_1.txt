You may need to replace your lost or stolen ID Card for the following reasons:

If you require a replacement ID, please visit the Registrar and Information Services office at any campus to request your ID Card. Bring a piece of valid, government-issued photo ID.

Cost to replace card: $20 (plus applicable tax)

Note: Once a replacement SFU card is issued, any previously issued SFU ID card will become inactive. If you find an inactive card, please destroy it.

The replacement card fee will be waived for students who provide proof of legal name change.

If you already have an SFU ID card and would like to get a new card with your chosen or new legal name, please review the information on the Changing your name site.
