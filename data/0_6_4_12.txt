International Services for Students (ISS) works with faculty who wish to develop an International Field School. Developing and Leading an International Field School is a 7 stage process, from conceptualizing the idea to wrapping up and assessing the program. See the International Field School Timeline for an overview of these 7 stages.

There is a unique set of pedagogies involved in developing and leading an International Field School. To help make our International Field School a great experience for you and your students, you are encouraged to review and incorporate International Field School Pedagogy throughout the process of both developing and leading an International Field School. Contact ISS at international_exchange@sfu.ca if you have any questions.
