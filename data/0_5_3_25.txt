Health & Counselling provides free, confidential, and time-limited counselling support for all SFU and FIC students currently enrolled in a term. Our team offers initial consultations and assessments, information and referrals, workshops, crisis support, safety planning, and individual and group counselling to address various concerns. Services are delivered by Registered Clinical Counsellors, Registered Psychologists, and their professional student trainees.

Health & Counselling offers brief, short-term counselling sessions, usually two to four weeks apart. Students typically attend three to four appointments, with the option for more based on individual needs after consultation with your counsellor.

Common concerns that may be addressed in brief/short-term therapy may include:

Monday to Friday | 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.

Appointments can be booked up two business days in advance by phone at 778-782-4615 or in-person.   

Schedule a Rapid Access / Intake Appointment

If you're looking for mental health support, like counselling, call the front desk at 778-782-4615 and ask to schedule an intake appointment. Availability permitting, within two business days you will be matched with the next available clinician.

Before your appointment, you will need to complete a brief questionnaire about your concerns and the type of support you are seeking. During your 30-minute appointment, the mental health clinician will ask questions to clarify your needs and review your questionnaire responses. Together, you will identify a goal and develop an action plan that includes resources tailored to address your concerns. This may include:

If you are referred to resources outside of Health and counselling, the Clinician will support and assist you in accessing appropriate community resources and referrals.

Are you a returning client?

You are encouraged to schedule a rapid access/intake appointment by calling the front desk. If you are looking for specialized counselling options, please book with the provider as required.

 lightbulb Did you know: At your rapid access/intake appointment you can express your preference for counsellor gender, language, background, and more.

Single Session Counselling Follow-up

You may be scheduled in a 30 or 50 minute, in person or remote, single session appointment to follow-up with your concerns presented during a rapid access/intake appointment.

At this appointment, the clinician will work with you to identify a detailed goal and action plan for addressing your support needs and creating change, which may also include being referred to additional resources such as short-term counselling, group counselling, or longer-term counselling in the community. 

Examples for why a single session follow up may be scheduled include: managing academic stress and anxiety around an exam or project, relationship issues with parents or partner, coping with a recent break-up, or skills for enhancing mood or sleep.

Short-Term Counselling    
   
When needed, Health & Counselling may offer brief/short-term counselling (one to four sessions) sometimes scheduled 2 to 4 weeks apart. 

Brief/short-term counselling is goal-oriented in nature and active participation in the process is essential for progress, change, and growth. At the beginning of your sessions, you will discuss the goals you would like to accomplish and you will be asked to provide your counsellor with feedback regarding service along the way in order to get the most out of your sessions.

Specific concerns well suited for short-term counselling include:  various kinds of anxiety (worry, social, test), stress, mild to moderate depression, adjustment and transition to university, acculturation, family and relationship concerns, loneliness, identity concerns.     

Following short-term counselling you may be referred to a group-based program, longer-term counselling in the community or other campus and community based supports.  

FAQ's

Group-based programs can help you develop skills, manage distress, and build social connections.  It can feel intimidating to join a group, but you will quickly discover you are not alone in your experiences, and you will gain collective support in a compassionate and productive way. Research shows that group-based programs can be even more effective than individual counselling.
