The Back on Track Program offers students in academic difficulty the opportunity to assess their academic choices, analyze their challenges, strengthen skills and develop strategies for future academic and personal success. The Program uses a combination of individual consultations, group meetings, in-person activities, and online learning opportunities which promote self-regulation, reflective practice and transformative learning. Successful program applicants, rather than be Required to Withdraw from the university, are eligible to participate in an Extended Academic Probation. In fact, successful students in the program have the “Required to Withdraw” standing removed from their permanent record.

The Back on Track Program is a three term program. Click below to learn more about the program requirements in each term.
