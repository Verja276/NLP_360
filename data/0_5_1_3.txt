Student Services Academic Advisors help admitted SFU undergraduates plan their degrees to meet their program requirements and their personal, professional and educational goals.

 

  

If you are inviting a support person to attend your appointment with you, we require your written consent to share and discuss your personal information in their presence.

Please note, prospective admissions advising, declared program planning, enrollment interventions, and internal transfers into the School of Engineering Science or the School for the Contemporary Arts are outside the scope of Student Services Advising services.
